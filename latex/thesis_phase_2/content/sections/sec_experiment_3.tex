\section{Determine the best Number of Cycles for the Evolutionary Algorithm }

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:exp3}
Given the chosen configuration from \autoref{sec:exp1} and the chosen hyperparameters of \autoref{sec:exp2}, we explore the effects of different stopping points for the evolutionary algorithm. 

We choose to run the configuration for evolution cycles from 5 to 100 in steps of 5. We keep the mutation rate at \attention{0.1} for each mutation type. The remaining procedure follows the process described in \autoref{sec:exp1}.

\subsection{Results}

\needsfigure{fig:num_cycles_result_1}{This bar-graph shows the effects of increasing the cycle count.}

\needstbl{tbl:viability_cycles}{This table shows the results of the mixed linear model using viability as dependent variable.}

\needstbl{tbl:feasibility_cycles}{This table shows the results of the mixed linear model using feasibility as dependent variable.}

As seen in \autoref{fig:num_cycles_result_1}, \attention{... TBD}.

\subsection{Discussion}
The results can be explained as \attention{... TBD}. Now, we can use this information to select \attention{XX} as optimal number of iteration cycles.
