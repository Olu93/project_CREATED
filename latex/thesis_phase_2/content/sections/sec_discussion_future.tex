With regards to future directions, it is worth pointing out, whether it is beneficial to employ other components of the viability structure. The measure described here clearly operationalised a set of criterions. However, there may be more aspects to also consider and generate even better counterfactuals. A good example would be diversity. In terms of other evolutionary approaches, it would be interesting to apply modern state-of-the-art methods, with the same viability measure.

% It would be interesting to see the out put of using \citeauthor{hsieh_DiCE4ELInterpretingProcess_2021}'s way to measure viability.
% \subsection{Inclusion of a better Measure for Sequential Feasibility}
% If the measure is probabilistic one could try to compute the expected probability given the sequence instead of just the probability.
% Furthermore, one could measure the feasibility by employing perplexity or another NLP evaluation metric.
