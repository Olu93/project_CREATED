Here, in this concrete example, we can see the bias of the viability measure. The best counterfactual is the shortest possible. We also see, that the counterfactual amount is smaller than the factual amount. The counterfactual resource is the same as the factual. Furthermore, the model now predicts the opposite outcome, of what it would have predicted beforehand.
