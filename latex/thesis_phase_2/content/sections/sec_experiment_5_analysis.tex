The results show that \attention{... TBD}. The increase of generation time can be explained by the viability measure. More specifically, the current implementation of the \gls{SSDLD} within the sparsity and similarity measure has a quadratic time complexity. The time complexity primarily depends on the maximal sequence length. The number of cases that are compared is less of a factor as we use a highly vectorized implementation of the distance using numpy.
