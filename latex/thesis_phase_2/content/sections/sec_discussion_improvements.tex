There are a number of improvements we propose. First, the feasibility metric compared to the other metrics oftern appeared far lower. The small probabilities, we saw are emblematic of the probablistic sphere. However, it would certainly help to find ways to operationalize feasibility and make it comparable to other viability components. Our ranking-based method showed, it is possible to overcome this issue, but a less opinionated solution would be more beneficial. 

Furthermore, we would like to stress that our approach is only as good as the prediction model it attempts to explain. To gain further insights into \emph{true} process models one would have to make sure that the prediction model is accurately reflecting the real word. Again, domain expert might help to deduce, which model is the best reflection of realistic phenomena.

% TODO: Ideas for better operators:
% Termination criterion based on ILL 
% Use other reranking orders

% The experiment mostly assumed a similar importance of each viability composite. Furthermore, crucial parts such as diversity where missing. For encoding binary encoding is not optimal, as dimension reduction might be more feasible. 
% \subsection{Employ Modern Evolutionary Algorithm Techniques like CMA-ES}
% At last, we have to point out, that
