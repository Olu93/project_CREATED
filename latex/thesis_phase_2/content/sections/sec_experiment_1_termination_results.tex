% We choose to run the configuration for evolution cycles from 5 to 100 in steps of 5. We keep the mutation rate at \attention{0.1} for each mutation type. The remaining procedure follows the process described in \autoref{sec:exp1}.

\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:exp3-normalized-lineplot}, we see a general increase in viability for each termination point. It shows, that increasing the termination point also yields better results at the end of the generation process. 
We see that \attention{CBI-ES-UC3-SBM-RR} returns the best results in the shortest time span. The model converges after roughly 50 iterative cycles. \attention{CBI-RWS-OPC-SBM-BBR} appears to have not reached convergence. 
The randomly initiated models have not reached convergence as well. However, they remain far below models that use a more sophisticated method to initialize their population.

    \caption{This figure shows the remaining measure components. Additionally, we show the ratio of events within the population. We also show a magnified version of the feasibility measure.}
    \label{fig:exp3-components}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:exp3-components} shows a decomposed view on how the viability measure evolves. Furthermore, we show the average amount of events within a generated counterfactual. 
In terms of similarity and sparcity all models behave similar. This is no surprise as both measures are ineherently interlinked. 
We see that the randomly initiated models (RI-x) decrease the amount of events they generate. 
Case-based initiated models appear to slightly gain more events. Although,  \attention{CBI-RWS-OPC-SBN-BBR} appears that reaches its saturation point significantly later (\attention{100}th cycle).
Interestingly, the \attention{CBI-RWS-OPC-SBM-BBR} model struggles to maintain feasibility and collapses to near 0 after the \attention{100th} iterative cycle. 
Another surprise is the steep ascention of only model that uses tournament selection (RI-TS-TPC-SBM-RR) towards the end of the generation process. The  model even overtakes the model that leads the model-configurations in terms of \attention{viability}. 
Furthermore, we see that {CBI-ES-UC-SBM-RR} has the highest feasibility among all models. However, it also quickly converges after 50 iterative cycles.

% Furthermore, in \autoref{fig:exp3-iterations-boxplots} reflects the spread of the indivual results. Unsurprisingly, low termination points yields a larger spread dispersion of viability. The values become less dispersed, the higher the termination point. \optional{However, there are some surprising outliers. First, the termination points 55, 60 and 90 seem to have an extremely low dispersion. Meaning most of their results have the same viability. It is not clear whether this is a rule or mere coincindence.} Also, the number of outliers increase with the termination point as well. A last noteworthy observation is the amount of solutions near the mark of \attention{1.8}, as depicted with the dotted line.
