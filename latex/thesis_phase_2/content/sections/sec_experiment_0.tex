\section{Choosing the Prediction Model and Feasibility Model}
Before testing any model we have to establish two crucial components of the viability measure. First, we require a prediction model which we want to explain using counterfactuals. This is relevant for determining the improvement that a counterfactual yileds in contrast to the factual. Second, we need to know to what extend any given counterfacual is feasbile given the dataset at hand. Therefore, we will dedicate the first set of experiments to establishing these components.
