In the result tables, you can see some of the factuals generated by our model and the model of \autocite{hsieh_DiCE4ELInterpretingProcess_2021}.

In this section, we show how both models (\optional{CBI-ES-UC3-SBM-RR} and \optional{CBI-RWS-OPC-SBM-FSR}) are capable of changing the outcome of the factual. Both models also return reasonable counterfactuals. However, \optional{CBI-ES-UC3-SBM-RR} appears to be more consistent with the counterpart of \autocite{hsieh_DiCE4ELInterpretingProcess_2021}. Especially in terms of the activity sequence. 
For instance, both our counterfactual and the D4EL counterfactual recognize that after O-SENT, there appears at least one \emph{W-Completeren aanvraag} and one \emph{W-Nabellen offertes} that eventually leads to an acceptance of the counterfactual. Both generate the latter activity correctly aligned with the factual. 
For instance, both evolutionary algorithms start the process with the correct sequence of A-SUBMITTED, A-PARTLYSUBMITTED and A-PREACCEPTED. 

Furthermore, our model appears to be much closer in terms of sequences than the model by \citeauthor{hsieh_DiCE4ELInterpretingProcess_2021}. \optional{CBI-RWS-OPC-SBM-FSR} (the model that only chooses the fittest survivors) has gaps. These gaps indicate that the model also attempts to align toward the correct structure of the factual model. We do not see that in \optional{CBI-ES-UC3-SBM-RR}, as it ranks feasibility above similarity and sparsity. The introduction of gaps in the sequence automatically reduces the feasibility of the model. 


% In the attachment, you will find more examples.


% This is reminiscent of the discussion in \autoref{sec:viability}.

% However, we also want to highlight two other examples. In

We also see that the value for \emph{Amount} fluctuates for the evolutionary generators. Similar holds for the resource field. The model focuses on event structure first and event attributes second. This might be seen as a limiting factor when it comes to event attributes. However, one could argue that the most revealing information the counterfactuals provide for sequences is within the sequence structure and less the event attributes. 

% We see this in \autoref{tbl:example-cf-evo} and \autoref{tbl:example-cf-cbg}. 
% Furthermore, the model with the highest feasibility among the \ModelEVO generated counterfactuals is also the one with the highest viability. 

% \autoref{tbl:example-cf-cbg} displays a counterfactual generated by the \ModelCBG. We see that its result appears to be more viable upon inspection. Here, all Amount variables are below the factual Amount. \citeauthor{hsieh_DiCE4ELInterpretingProcess_2021} interprets this as a reasonable result. The authors state that we can interpret the result as having better chances of a successful loan application process if we request a lower loan. The results for the \ModelCBG show that the viability measure \emph{does} capture a notion of viability. However, generating realistic counterfactuals for models that optimize it is not enough. 



% The results also seem unrealistic as an O-SELECTED cannot follow after an A-ACCEPTED activity. The counterfactual managed to be the best, despite having zero feasibility.
