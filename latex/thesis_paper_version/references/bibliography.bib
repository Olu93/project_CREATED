  year = {2022},
  month = jan,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another, first proposed in 1969. Ordinarily, regressions reflect "mere" correlations, but Clive Granger argued that causality in economics could be tested for by measuring the ability to predict the future values of a time series using prior values of another time series. Since the question of "true causality" is deeply philosophical, and because of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy of assuming that one thing preceding another can be used as a proof of causation, econometricians assert that the Granger test finds only "predictive causality". Using the term "causality" alone is a misnomer, as Granger-causality is better described as  "precedence", or, as Granger himself later claimed in 1977, "temporally related". Rather than testing whether X causes Y, the Granger causality tests whether X forecasts Y.A time series X is said to Granger-cause Y if it can be shown, usually through a series of t-tests and F-tests on lagged values of X (and with lagged values of Y also included), that those X values provide statistically significant information about future values of Y. Granger also stressed that some studies using "Granger causality" testing in areas outside economics reached "ridiculous" conclusions. "Of course, many ridiculous papers appeared", he said in his Nobel lecture. However, it remains a popular method for causality analysis in time series due to its computational simplicity. The original definition of Granger causality does not account for latent confounding effects and does not capture instantaneous and non-linear causal relationships, though several extensions have been proposed to address these issues.},

@article{_StatespaceRepresentation_2021,
  title = {State-Space Representation},
  year = {2021},
  month = nov,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations or difference equations. State variables are variables whose values evolve over time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables' values depend on the values of the state variables. The "state space" is the Euclidean space in which the variables on the axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a state vector within that space. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs and states, these variables are expressed as vectors.  If the dynamical system is linear, time-invariant, and finite-dimensional, then the differential and algebraic equations may be written in matrix form. The state-space method is characterized by significant algebraization of general system theory, which makes it possible to use Kronecker vector-matrix structures. The capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with modulation or without it.  The state-space representation (also known as the "time-domain approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With                         p                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle p\}    inputs and                         q                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle q\}    outputs, we would otherwise have to write down                         q         \texttimes{}         p                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle q\textbackslash times p\}    Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. The state-space model can be applied in subjects such as economics, statistics, computer science and electrical engineering, and neuroscience. In econometrics, for example, state-space models can be used to decompose a time series into trend and cycle, compose individual indicators into a composite index, identify turning points of the business cycle, and estimate GDP using latent and unobserved time series. Many applications rely on the Kalman Filter to produce estimates of the current unknown state variables using their previous observations.},

"Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensor motor knowledge. We are all prodigious Olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it."- Hans Moravec Moravec's paradox is involved with the fact that it is the seemingly easier day to day problems that are harder to implement in a machine, than the seemingly complicated logic based problems of today. The results prove that most artificially intelligent machines are as adept if not more than us at under-taking long calculations or even play chess, but their logic brings them nowhere when it comes to carrying out everyday tasks like walking, facial gesture recognition or speech recognition.},

In this article, we present a survey of many works which apply EAs to different NLP problems, including syntactic and semantic analysis, grammar induction, summaries and text generation, document clustering and machine translation. This review finishes extracting conclusions about which are the best suited problems or particular aspects within those problems to be solved with an evolutionary algorithm.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series are used in many science and engineering domains, including health-care, astronomy, and high-performance computing. A recent trend is to use machine learning (ML) to process this complex data and these ML-based frameworks are starting to play a critical role for a variety of applications. However, barriers such as user distrust or difficulty of debugging need to be overcome to enable widespread adoption of such frameworks in production systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel explainability technique, CoMTE, that provides counterfactual explanations for supervised machine learning frameworks on multivariate time series data. Using various machine learning frameworks and data sets, we compare CoMTE with several state-of-the-art explainability methods and show that we outperform existing methods in comprehensibility and robustness. We also show how CoMTE can be used to debug machine learning frameworks and gain a better understanding of the underlying multivariate time series data.},

Whether improved productivity leads to additional investment in IT, however, remains largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we consider whether the relationship between productivity and subsequent IT investment might be positive, negative, or ad hoc, and hypothesize that this relationship is positive. We analyze seven years of panel data from 1,223 healthcare firms and present empirical evidence supporting our hypothesis. When our finding is combined with extant research, it becomes reasonable to propose that unidirectional causality does not fully describe the process of IT business value creation. Instead, we argue that existing static models of IT business value with unidirectional causality can be recast as dynamic models that explicitly incorporate multiple time periods and a positive feedback relationship to more accurately capture the complexity of this process. The creation of IT business value can thus be understood as a positive feedback model where productivity in a given time period leads to IT investment in a future time period, where IT investment builds the stock of IT inputs, and where those IT inputs then impact productivity, beginning the cycle anew.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary computation has shown great performance in solving many multi-objective optimization problems; in many such algorithms, non-dominated sorting plays an important role in determining the relative quality of solutions in a population. However, the implementation of non-dominated sorting can be computationally expensive, especially for populations with a large number of solutions and many objectives. The main reason is that most existing non-dominated sorting algorithms need to compare one solution with almost all others to determine its front, and many of these comparisons are redundant or unnecessary. Another reason is that as the number of objectives increases, more and more candidate solutions become non-dominated solutions, and most existing time-saving approaches cannot work effectively. In this paper, we present a novel non-dominated sorting strategy, called Hierarchical Non-Dominated Sorting (HNDS). HNDS first sorts all candidate solutions in ascending order by their first objective. Then it compares the first solution with all others one by one to make a rapid distinction between different quality solutions, thereby avoiding many unnecessary comparisons. Experiments on populations with different numbers of solutions, different numbers of objectives and different problems have been done. The results show that HNDS has better computational efficiency than fast non-dominated sort, Arena's principle and deductive sort.},

In this work, we introduce and study an RNN-based variational autoencoder generative model that incorporates distributed latent representations of entire sentences. This factorization allows it to explicitly model holistic properties of sentences such as style, topic, and high-level syntactic features. Samples from the prior over these sentence representations remarkably produce diverse and well-formed sentences through simple deterministic decoding. By examining paths through this latent space, we are able to generate coherent novel sentences that interpolate between known sentences. We present techniques for solving the difficult learning problem presented by this model, demonstrate its effectiveness in imputing missing words, explore many interesting properties of the model's latent sentence space, and present negative results on the use of the model in language modeling.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is the leading algorithm for solving large imperfect-information games. It converges to an equilibrium by iteratively traversing the game tree. In order to deal with extremely large games, abstraction is typically applied before running CFR. The abstracted game is solved with tabular CFR, and its solution is mapped back to the full game. This process can be problematic because aspects of abstraction are often manual and domain specific, abstraction algorithms may miss important strategic nuances of the game, and there is a chicken-and-egg problem because determining a good abstraction requires knowledge of the equilibrium of the game. This paper introduces Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization, a form of CFR that obviates the need for abstraction by instead using deep neural networks to approximate the behavior of CFR in the full game. We show that Deep CFR is principled and achieves strong performance in large poker games. This is the first non-tabular variant of CFR to be successful in large games.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have recently found applications in the field of predictive business process monitoring. These techniques allow us to predict, among other things, what will be the next events in a case, when will they occur, and which resources will trigger them. They also allow us to generate entire execution traces of a business process, or even entire event logs, which opens up the possibility of using such models for process simulation. This paper addresses the question of how to use deep learning techniques to train accurate models of business process behavior from event logs. The paper proposes an approach to train recurrent neural networks with Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture in order to predict sequences of next events, their timestamp, and their associated resource pools. An experimental evaluation on real-life event logs shows that the proposed approach outperforms previously proposed LSTM architectures targeted at this problem.},

This paper investigates the strengths of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for extractive summarization, as we hypothesized that GAs could construct more efficient solutions for the summarization task due to their relative customizability relative to deep learning models. This is done by building a vocabulary set, the words of which are represented as an array of weights, and optimizing those set of weights with the GA. These weights can be used to build an overall weighting of a sentence, which can then be passed to some threshold for extraction. Our results showed that the GA was able to learn a weight representation that could filter out excessive vocabulary and thus dictate sentence importance based on common English words.},

Our approach not only returns a diverse set of counterfactuals with different trade-offs between the proposed objectives, but also maintains diversity in feature space. This enables a more detailed post-hoc analysis to facilitate better understanding and also more options for actionable user responses to change the predicted outcome. Our approach is also model-agnostic and works for numerical and categorical input features. We show the usefulness of MOC in concrete cases and compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods for counterfactual explanations.},

  abstract = {Optimizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution can help plan around the limited production and distribution of vaccination, particularly in early stages. One of the main criteria for equitable vaccine distribution is predicting the geographic distribution of active virus at the time of vaccination. This research developed sequence-learning models to predict the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic across the US, based on previously reported information. For this objective, we used two time-series datasets of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers from January 22, 2020 to November 26, 2020 for all states in the US. The datasets have 310 time-steps (days) and 50 features (US states). To avoid training the models for all states, we categorized US states on the basis of their similarity to previously reported COVID-19 behavior. For this purpose, we used an unsupervised self-organizing map to categorize all states of the US into four groups on the basis of the similarity of their effective reproduction numbers. After selecting a leading state (the state with earliest outbreaks) in each group, we developed deterministic and stochastic Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Mixture Density Network (MDN) models. We trained the models with data from each leading state to make predictions, then compared the models with a baseline linear regression model. We also remove seasonality and trends from a dataset of non-stationary COVID-19 cases to determine the effects on prediction. We showed that the deterministic LSTM model trained on the COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers outperforms other prediction methods.},

One of the key problems of a data-driven analysis of processes, is the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we address this problem by developing representation learning techniques for business processes. More specifically, the representation learning paradigm is applied to activities, traces, logs, and models in order to learn highly informative but low-dimensional vectors, often referred to as embeddings, based on a neural network architecture. Subsequently, these vectors can be used for automated inference tasks such as trace clustering, process comparison, predictive process monitoring, anomaly detection, etc. Accordingly, the main contribution of this paper is the proposal of representation learning architectures at the level of activities, traces, logs, and models that can produce a distributed representation of these objects and a thorough analysis of potential applications. In an experimental evaluation, we show the power of such derived representations in the context of trace clustering and process model comparison.},

  abstract = {Time series classification deals with the problem of classification of data that is multivariate in nature. This means that one or more of the attributes is in the form of a sequence. The notion of similarity or distance, used in time series data, is significant and affects the accuracy, time, and space complexity of the classification algorithm. There exist numerous similarity measures for time series data, but each of them has its own disadvantages. Instead of relying upon a single similarity measure, our aim is to find the near optimal solution to the classification problem by combining different similarity measures. In this work, we use genetic algorithms to combine the similarity measures so as to get the best performance. The weightage given to different similarity measures evolves over a number of generations so as to get the best combination. We test our approach on a number of benchmark time series datasets and present promising results.},

However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.},

Given a textual input and a classification model, we aim to minimally alter the text to change the model's prediction. White-box approaches have been successfully applied to similar problems in vision where one can directly optimize the continuous input. Optimization-based approaches become difficult in the language domain due to the discrete nature of text. We bypass this issue by directly optimizing in the latent space and leveraging a language model to generate candidate modifications from optimized latent representations. We additionally use Shapley values to estimate the combinatoric effect of multiple changes. We then use these estimates to guide a beam search for the final counterfactual text. We achieve favorable performance compared to recent white-box and black-box baselines using human and automatic evaluations. Ablation studies show that both latent optimization and the use of Shapley values improve success rate and the quality of the generated counterfactuals.},

By retaining both the nonlinear recursive structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a latent path, like a state space model, we improve the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TTMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin, while achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music modeling.},

Unfortunately, when a dataset has systematic gaps (e.g., annotation artifacts), these evaluations are misleading: a model can learn simple decision rules that perform well on the test set but do not capture a dataset's intended capabilities. We propose a new annotation paradigm for NLP that helps to close systematic gaps in the test data. In particular, after a dataset is constructed, we recommend that the dataset authors manually perturb the test instances in small but meaningful ways that (typically) change the gold label, creating contrast sets. Contrast sets provide a local view of a model's decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model's true linguistic capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of contrast sets by creating them for 10 diverse NLP datasets (e.g., DROP reading comprehension, UD parsing, IMDb sentiment analysis). Although our contrast sets are not explicitly adversarial, model performance is significantly lower on them than on the original test sets---up to 25\textbackslash\% in some cases. We release our contrast sets as new evaluation benchmarks and encourage future dataset construction efforts to follow similar annotation processes.},

Fitness comparisons among solutions in single-objective optimization is straightforward, but when dealing with multiple objectives, it becomes a non-trivial task. Pareto dominance has been the most commonly adopted relation to compare solutions in a multiobjective optimization context. However, it has been shown that as the number of objectives increases, the convergence ability of approaches based on Pareto dominance decreases. In this paper, we propose three novel fitness assignment methods for many-objective optimization. We also perform a comparative study in order to investigate how effective are the proposed approaches to guide the search in high-dimensional objective spaces. Results indicate that our approaches behave better than six state-of-the-art fitness assignment methods.},

  abstract = {The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a powerful deep generative model that is now extensively used to represent high-dimensional complex data via a low-dimensional latent space learned in an unsupervised manner. In the original VAE model, input data vectors are processed independently. In recent years, a series of papers have presented different extensions of the VAE to process sequential data, that not only model the latent space, but also model the temporal dependencies within a sequence of data vectors and corresponding latent vectors, relying on recurrent neural networks or state space models. In this paper we perform an extensive literature review of these models. Importantly, we introduce and discuss a general class of models called Dynamical Variational Autoencoders (DVAEs) that encompasses a large subset of these temporal VAE extensions. Then we present in detail seven different instances of DVAE that were recently proposed in the literature, with an effort to homogenize the notations and presentation lines, as well as to relate these models with existing classical temporal models. We reimplemented those seven DVAE models and we present the results of an experimental benchmark conducted on the speech analysis-resynthesis task (the PyTorch code is made publicly available). The paper is concluded with an extensive discussion on important issues concerning the DVAE class of models and future research guidelines.},

While research in process mining predominantly focuses on the technical aspects, our work highlights organizational and managerial implications. Design/methodology/approach We report on a focus group study conducted with process managers from various industries in Central Europe. This setting allowed us to gain diverse and in-depth insights about the needs and expectations of practitioners in relation to the adoption, use and management of process mining. Findings We find that process managers face four central challenges. These challenges are largely related to four stages; (1) planning and business case calculation, (2) process selection, (3) implementation, and (4) process mining use. Research limitations/implications We point to research opportunities in relation to the adoption, use and management of process mining. We suggest that future research should apply interdisciplinary study designs to better understand the managerial and organizational implications of process mining. Practical implications The reported challenges have various practical implications at the organizational and managerial level. We explore how existing BPM frameworks can be extended to meet these challenges. Originality/value This study is among the first attempts to explore process mining from the perspective of process managers.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a useful latent representation and model global structure well but have difficulty capturing small details. PixelCNN models details very well, but lacks a latent code and is difficult to scale for capturing large structures. We present PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN. Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64x64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.},

Because of the rapidly developing and interdisciplinary nature of the subject, there are only a few edited volumes consisting of research papers on intelligent control systems but little is known and published about the fundamentals and the general know-how in designing, implementing and operating intelligent control systems.  Intelligent control system emerged from artificial intelligence and computer controlled systems as an interdisciplinary field. Therefore the book summarizes the fundamentals of knowledge representation, reasoning, expert systems and real-time control systems and then discusses the design, implementation verification and operation of real-time expert systems using G2 as an example. Special tools and techniques applied in intelligent control are also described including qualitative modelling, Petri nets and fuzzy controllers. The material is illlustrated with simple examples taken from the field of intelligent process control.  Audience: The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate students and graduate engineering students. In addition, practicing engineers will find it appropriate for self-study.},

If a first work to improve the extraction of low frequency words showed significant improvement while using distance-based averaging (Pekar et al., 2006), no investigation of the many smoothing techniques has been carried out so far. In this paper, we present a study of some widelyused smoothing algorithms for language n-gram modeling (Laplace, Good-Turing, Kneser-Ney...). Our main contribution is to investigate how the different smoothing techniques affect the performance of the standard approach (Fung, 1998) traditionally used for bilingual lexicon extraction. We show that using smoothing as a preprocessing step of the standard approach increases its performance significantly.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}

With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

In addition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted as affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution over attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly) as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work, we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations' for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be treated as though they do.

  abstract = {The objective of entity alignment is to judge whether entities refer to the same object in the real world. Methods for entity alignment can be grossly divided into two groups: conventional symbol-based entity alignment methods and embedding-based entity alignment methods. Both groups of methods have advantages and disadvantages (which are detailed in Section 1). Therefore, combining the advantages of both methods might be a promising strategy. However, to the best of our knowledge, only the RTEA algorithm that was proposed in our previous conference paper (Proceeding of Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 162\textendash 175, 2019) utilizes this strategy for entity alignment. This manuscript is an extended version of that conference paper, in which an improved algorithm, namely, ESEA (combining embedding-based and symbol-based methods for entity alignment), is proposed based on the following steps. First, a novel method for combining embedding models with symbol-based models is proposed. Entities with high vector similarities are obtained through a hybrid embedding model, and the final aligned entity pairs are calculated via symbol-based methods. Second, a series of symbol-based methods, instead of only the edit distance method in the original version, are combined with embedding-based methods for relation alignment. Third, we combine symbol-based and embedding-based methods in a more complicated framework with the objective of better exploiting the advantages of both methods. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed several state-of-the-art embedding-based entity alignment approaches and outperformed our previous RTEA method.},

The time series are either given in one batch (offline setting), or they are allowed to grow with time and new time series can be added along the way (online setting). We propose a natural notion of consistency for this problem, and show that there are simple, computationally efficient algorithms that are asymptotically consistent under extremely weak assumptions on the distributions that generate the data. The notion of consistency is as follows. A clustering algorithm is called consistent if it places two time series into the same cluster if and only if the distribution that generates them is the same. In the considered framework the time series are allowed to be highly dependent, and the dependence can have arbitrary form. If the number of clusters is known, the only assumption we make is that the (marginal) distribution of each time series is stationary ergodic. No parametric, memory or mixing assumptions are made. When the number of clusters is unknown, stronger assumptions are provably necessary, but it is still possible to devise nonparametric algorithms that are consistent under very general conditions. The theoretical findings of this work are illustrated with experiments on both synthetic and real data.},

  abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

A key question in the context of process improvement is how response s to an event (action) result in desired or undesired outcomes (effects). From a process perspective, this requires understanding the action-response patterns that occur. Current discovery techniques do not allow organizations to gain such insights. In this paper we present a novel approach to tackle this problem. We propose and formalize a technique to discover action-response-effect patterns. In this technique we use well-established statistical tests to uncover potential dependency relations between each response and its effect s on the cases. The goal of this technique is to provide organizations with processes that are: (1) appropriately represented, and (2) effectively filtered to show meaningful relations. The approach is evaluated on a real-world data set from a Dutch healthcare facility in the context of aggressive behavior of clients and the response s of caretakers.},

By providing interactive partial dependence diagnostics, data scientists can understand how features affect the prediction overall. In addition, our support for localized inspection allows data scientists to understand how and why specific datapoints are predicted as they are, as well as support for tweaking feature values and seeing how the prediction responds. Our system is then evaluated using a case study involving a team of data scientists improving predictive models for detecting the onset of diabetes from electronic medical records.},

In additions to Optimization it also serves the purpose of machine learning and for Research and development. It is analogous to biology for chromosome generation with variables such as selection, crossover and mutation together constituting genetic operations which would be applicable on a random population initially. GA aims to yield solutions for the consecutive generations. The extent of success in individual production is directly in proportion to fitness of solution which is represented by it, thereby ensuring that quality in successive generations will be better. The process is concluded once an GA is most suitable for the issues that need optimization associated with some computable system.. John Holland may be regarded as funding father of original genetic algorithm and is attributed to year 1970's as funding date. Additionally a random search method represented by Charles Darwin for a defined search space in order to effetely solve a problem.

While often effective, this decoupling requires specifying two separate models, each with their own complexities, and prevents capturing more nuanced long-range spatiotemporal relationships. We propose a unified approach, as demonstrated by our Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), that hierarchically captures relationships at low-, intermediate-, and high-level time-scales. Our model achieves superior or competitive performance using video or sensor data on three public action segmentation datasets and can be trained in a fraction of the time it takes to train an RNN.},

We achieve these benefits by combining concepts from game theory and reinforcement learning. To be precise, we extend the bounded rational ''level-K reasoning'' model to apply to games over multiple stages. Our extension allows the decomposition of the overall modeling problem into a series of smaller ones, each of which can be solved by standard reinforcement learning algorithms. We call this hybrid approach ''level-K reinforcement learning''. We investigate these ideas in a cyber battle scenario over a smart power grid and discuss the relationship between the behavior predicted by our model and what one might expect of real human defenders and attackers.},

Even though event logs provide insights into the likelihood of observed behaviour, most state-of-the-art conformance checking techniques ignore this point of view. In this paper, we propose a conformance measure that considers the stochastic characteristics of both the event log and the process model. It is based on the ``earth movers' distance'' and measures the effort to transform the distributions of traces of the event log into the distribution of traces of the model. We formalize this intuitive conformance metric and provide an approximation and a simplified variant. The latter two have been implemented in ProM and we evaluate them using several real-life examples.},

Our deep generative model learns a latent representation of the data which is split into a static and dynamic part, allowing us to approximately disentangle latent time-dependent features (dynamics) from features which are preserved over time (content). This architecture gives us partial control over generating content and dynamics by conditioning on either one of these sets of features. In our experiments on artificially generated cartoon video clips and voice recordings, we show that we can convert the content of a given sequence into another one by such content swapping. For audio, this allows us to convert a male speaker into a female speaker and vice versa, while for video we can separately manipulate shapes and dynamics. Furthermore, we give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that stochastic RNNs as latent state models are more efficient at compressing and generating long sequences than deterministic ones, which may be relevant for applications in video compression.},

OLM is used to rank words of a sentence, which are later substituted using word replacement strategies. We experimentally show that our approach outperforms other attack methods for several text classification tasks.},

We analyzed the trajectories of patients in a Dutch hospital from their registration in the emergency room until their discharge. We considered a sample of 1050 patients with symptoms of a sepsis condition, which is a life-threatening condition. We extracted an event log that includes events on activities in the emergency room, admission to hospital wards, and discharge. The event log was enriched with data from laboratory tests and triage checklists.We try to automatically discover a process model of the patient trajectories, we check conformance to medical guidelines for sepsis patients, and visualize the flow of patients on a de-jure process model. The lessons-learned from this analysis are: (1) process mining can be used to clarify the patient flow in a hospital; (2) process mining can be used to check the daily clinical practice against medical guidelines; (3) process discovery methods  may return unsuitable models that are difficult to understand for stakeholders; and (4) process mining is an iterative process, e.g., data quality issues are often discovered and need to be addressed.},

The increased interest in this area is mainly due to the success of deep learning methods. Genetic Programming (GP), however, was not under the spotlight with respect to NLP tasks. Here, we propose a first proof-of-concept that combines GP with the well established NLP tool word2vec for the next word prediction task. The main idea is that, once words have been moved into a vector space, traditional GP operators can successfully work on vectors, thus producing meaningful words as the output. To assess the suitability of this approach, we perform an experimental evaluation on a set of existing newspaper headlines. Individuals resulting from this (pre-)training phase can be employed as the initial population in other NLP tasks, like sentence generation, which will be the focus of future investigations, possibly employing adversarial co-evolutionary approaches.},

Predictive models treat documents as data to be classified, and document data are characterized by very high dimensionality, often with tens of thousands to millions of variables (words). Unfortunately, due to the high dimensionality, understanding the decisions made by document classifiers is very difficult. This paper begins by extending the most relevant prior theoretical model of explanations for intelligent systems to account for some missing elements. The main theoretical contribution is the definition of a new sort of explanation as a minimal set of words (terms, generally), such that removing all words within this set from the document changes the predicted class from the class of interest. We present an algorithm to find such explanations, as well as a framework to assess such an algorithm's performance. We demonstrate the value of the new approach with a case study from a real-world document classification task: classifying web pages as containing objectionable content, with the goal of allowing advertisers to choose not to have their ads appear on those pages. A second empirical demonstration on news-story topic classification shows the explanations to be concise and document-specific, and to be capable of providing understanding of the exact reasons for the classification decisions, of the workings of the classification models, and of the business application itself. We also illustrate how explaining the classifications of documents can help to improve data quality and model performance.},

However, these perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change the input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the expected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the growing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial attacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and post-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that existing methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the aforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in changes in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate that adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial perturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change the output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of adversarial robustness, without hurting test performance. A toolkit implementing our evaluation framework is released at https://github.com/pmichel31415/teapot-nlp.},

Processes require analysis and process owners need to constantly look for methods to improve process performance indicators. It is non-trivial to quantify the improvement of a proposed change, without implementing or conducting randomized controlled trials. In several cases, the cost and time for implementing and evaluating the benefits of these changes are high. To address this, we propose a principled framework using Structural Causal Models which formally codify existing cause-effect assumptions about the process, control confounding and answer ``what if'' questions with observational data. We formally define an end to end methodology which takes process execution logs and specified BPMN model as inputs for structural causal model discovery and for performing counterfactual reasoning. We show that exploiting the process specification for causal discovery automatically ensures the inclusion of subject matter expertise, and also provides an effective computational methodology. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by answering intervention and counterfactual questions on example process models.},

However, most existing approaches assume instant materialization of these changes, ignoring that they may require effort and a specific order of application. Recently, methods have been proposed that also consider the order in which actions are applied, leading to the so-called sequential counterfactual generation problem. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic method for sequential counterfactual generation. We formulate the task as a multi-objective optimization problem and present a genetic algorithm approach to find optimal sequences of actions leading to the counterfactuals. Our cost model considers not only the direct effect of an action, but also its consequences. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art, our approach generates less costly solutions, is more efficient and provides the user with a diverse set of solutions to choose from.},

Pearl adheres to several propositions on cause  and effect inference. Though cause and effect relations are  fundamentally deterministic (he explicitly excludes quantum mechanical  phenomena from his concept of cause and effect), cause and effect  analysis involves probability language. Probability language helps to  convey uncertainty about cause and effect relations but is insufficient  to fully express those relations. In addition to conditional  probabilities of events, cause and effect analysis requires graphs or  diagrams and a language that distinguishes intervention or manipulation  from observation. Cause and effect analysis also requires  counterfactual reasoning and causal assumptions in addition to  observations and statistical assumptions.},

We demonstrate that BINet can be used to detect anomalies in event logs not only on a case level, but also on event attribute level. We compare BINet to 6 other state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms and evaluate their performance on an elaborate data corpus of 60 synthetic and 21 real life event logs using artificial anomalies. BINet reached an average F1F1F\_1 score over all detection levels of 0.83, whereas the next best approach, a denoising autoencoder, reached only 0.74.

  abstract = {We introduce an off-policy evaluation procedure for highlighting episodes where applying a reinforcement learned (RL) policy is likely to have produced a substantially different outcome than the observed policy. In particular, we introduce a class of structural causal models (SCMs) for generating counterfactual trajectories in finite partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We see this as a useful procedure for off-policy "debugging" in high-risk settings (e.g., healthcare); by decomposing the expected difference in reward between the RL and observed policy into specific episodes, we can identify episodes where the counterfactual difference in reward is most dramatic. This in turn can be used to facilitate review of specific episodes by domain experts. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure with a synthetic environment of sepsis management.},

Pattern recognition encompasses two fundamental tasks: description and classification. Given an object to analyze, a pattern recognition system first generates a description of it (i.e., the pattern) and then classifies the object based on that description (i.e., the recognition). Two general approaches for implementing pattern recognition systems, statistical and structural, employ different techniques for description and classification. Statistical approaches to pattern recognition use decision-theoretic concepts to discriminate among objects belonging to different groups based upon their quantitative features. Structural approaches to pattern recognition use syntactic grammars to discriminate among objects belonging to different groups based upon the arrangement of their morphological (i.e., shape-based or structural) features. Hybrid approaches to pattern recognition combine aspects of both statistical and structural pattern recognition.  Structural pattern recognition systems are difficult to apply to new domains because implementation of both the description and classification tasks requires domain knowledge. Knowledge acquisition techniques necessary to obtain domain knowledge from experts are tedious and often fail to produce a complete and accurate knowledge base. Consequently, applications of structural pattern recognition have been primarily restricted to domains in which the set of useful morphological features has been established in the literature (e.g., speech recognition and character recognition) and the syntactic grammars can be composed by hand (e.g., electrocardiogram diagnosis). To overcome this limitation, a domain-independent approach to structural pattern recognition is needed that is capable of extracting morphological features and performing classification without relying on domain knowledge. A hybrid system that employs a statistical classification technique to perform discrimination based on structural features is a natural solution. While a statistical classifier is inherently domain independent, the domain knowledge necessary to support the description task can be eliminated with a set of generally-useful morphological features. Such a set of morphological features is suggested as the foundation for the development of a suite of structure detectors to perform generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data.  The ability of the suite of structure detectors to generate features useful for structural pattern recognition is evaluated by comparing the classification accuracies achieved when using the structure detectors versus commonly-used statistical feature extractors. Two real-world databases with markedly different characteristics and established ground truth serve as sources of data for the evaluation. The classification accuracies achieved using the features extracted by the structure detectors were consistently as good as or better than the classification accuracies achieved when using the features generated by the statistical feature extractors, thus demonstrating that the suite of structure detectors effectively performs generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data.},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

Here, we explore ways to a solution for this problem by investigating recent advances in generative modeling and present a study for the generation of events from a physical process with deep generative models. The simulation of physical processes requires not only the production of physical events, but to also ensure that these events occur with the correct frequencies. We investigate the feasibility of learning the event generation and the frequency of occurrence with several generative machine learning models to produce events like Monte Carlo generators. We study three processes: a simple two-body decay, the processes e+e-\,\textrightarrow\,Z\,\textrightarrow\,l+l- and \$\$pp\textbackslash to t\textbackslash bar\{t\}\$\$including the decay of the top quarks and a simulation of the detector response. By buffering density information of encoded Monte Carlo events given the encoder of a Variational Autoencoder we are able to construct a prior for the sampling of new events from the decoder that yields distributions that are in very good agreement with real Monte Carlo events and are generated several orders of magnitude faster. Applications of this work include generic density estimation and sampling, targeted event generation via a principal component analysis of encoded ground truth data, anomaly detection and more efficient importance sampling, e.g., for the phase space integration of matrix elements in quantum field theories.},

Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.},

This algorithm has been tested on different tasks involving different pair of languages. Specifically, in the two shared tasks proposed in the HLT-NAACL 2003 and in the ACL 2005, the EDA-based algorithm outperforms the best participant systems. In addition, the experiments show that, because of the limitations of the well known statistical alignment models, new improvements in alignments quality could not be achieved by using improved search algorithms only.},

Most previous approaches require a separate, computationally expensive optimization procedure per instance, making them impractical for both large amounts of data and high-dimensional data. Moreover, these methods are often restricted to certain subclasses of machine learning models (e.g. differentiable or tree-based models). In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that transforms the optimization procedure into an end-to-end learnable process, allowing us to generate batches of counterfactual instances in a single forward pass. Our experiments on real-world data show that our method i) is model-agnostic (does not assume differentiability), relying only on feedback from model predictions; ii) allows for generating target-conditional counterfactual instances; iii) allows for flexible feature range constraints for numerical and categorical attributes, including the immutability of protected features (e.g. gender, race); iv) is easily extended to other data modalities such as images.},

  abstract = {In a broad range of fields it may be desirable to reuse a supervised classification algorithm and apply it to a new data set. However, generalization of such an algorithm and thus achieving a similar classification performance is only possible when the training data used to build the algorithm is similar to new unseen data one wishes to apply it to. It is often unknown in advance how an algorithm will perform on new unseen data, being a crucial reason for not deploying an algorithm at all. Therefore, tools are needed to measure the similarity of data sets. In this paper, we propose the Data Representativeness Criterion (DRC) to determine how representative a training data set is of a new unseen data set. We present a proof of principle, to see whether the DRC can quantify the similarity of data sets and whether the DRC relates to the performance of a supervised classification algorithm. We compared a number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets, ranging from subtle to severe difference is acquisition parameters. Results indicate that, based on the similarity of data sets, the DRC is able to give an indication as to when the performance of a supervised classifier decreases. The strictness of the DRC can be set by the user, depending on what one considers to be an acceptable underperformance.},

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its 'reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

Like other artificial intelligence techniques, evolutionary algorithms will likely see increased use and development due to the increased availability of computation, more robust and available open source software libraries, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence techniques. As these techniques become more adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a perspective of their ability to integrate into society and the human processes they intend to augment. In this review, we explore a new taxonomy of evolutionary algorithms and resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the ability to manage the control of the environment with limiters, the ability to explain and repeat the search process, the ability to understand input and output causality within a solution, the ability to manage algorithm bias due to data or user design, and lastly, the ability to add corrective measures. These areas are motivated by today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies concerns and new government regulatory rules. As many reviews of evolutionary algorithms exist, after motivating this new taxonomy, we briefly classify a broad range of algorithms and identify areas of future research.},

What if the Americashad never been colonized? What if I were to put that box over here andthis one over there? These modes of thought and speech have been thesubject of extensive study in philosophy, linguistics, psychology,artificial intelligence, history, and many other allied fields. Thesediverse investigations are united by the fact that counterfactualmodality crops up at the center of foundational questions in thesefields., In philosophy, counterfactual modality has given rise to difficultsemantic, epistemological, and metaphysical questions:, These questions have attracted significant attention in recentdecades, revealing a wealth of puzzles and insights. While otherentries address the epistemic\textemdash the epistemology of modality\textemdash and metaphysical questions\textemdash possible worlds and actualism\textemdash this entry focuses on the semantic question. It will aim to refine thisquestion, explain its central role in certain philosophical debates,and outline the main semantic analyses of counterfactuals.,  Section 1 begins with a working definition of counterfactual conditionals (\textsection 1.1), and then surveys how counterfactuals feature in theories of agency,mental representation, and rationality (\textsection 1.2), and how they are used in metaphysical analysis and scientificexplanation (\textsection 1.3). Section 1.4 then details several ways in which the logic andtruth-conditions of counterfactuals are puzzling. This sets the stagefor the sections 2 and 3, which survey semantic analyses of counterfactuals that attempt toexplain this puzzling behavior.,  Section 2 focuses on two related analyses that were primarily developed tostudy the logic of counterfactuals: strict conditionalanalyses and similarity analyses. These analyses were not originallyconcerned with saying what the truth-conditions of particularcounterfactuals are. Attempts to extend them to that domain, however,have attracted intense criticism. Section 3 surveys more recent analyses that offer more explicit models of whencounterfactuals are true. These analyses include premise semantics (\textsection 3.1), conditional probability analyses (\textsection 3.2) and structural equations/causal models (\textsection 3.3). They are more closely connected to work on counterfactuals inpsychology, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy ofscience., Sections 2 and 3 of this entry employ some basic tools from set theory and logicalsemantics. But these sections also provide intuitive characterizationsalongside formal definitions, so familiarity with these tools is not apre-requisite. Readers interested in more familiarity with these toolswill find basic set theory, as well as Gamut (1991) and Sider(2010) useful.},

Existing methods in this space are tailor-made for specific prediction tasks.

This paper investigates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as an approach to build consistently accurate models for a wide range of predictive process monitoring tasks. First, we show that LSTMs outperform existing techniques to predict the next event of a running case and its timestamp. Next, we show how to use models for predicting the next task in order to predict the full continuation of a running case. Finally, we apply the same approach to predict the remaining time, and show that this approach outperforms existing tailor-made methods.},

Motivated by the increasingly pervasive availability of fine-grained event data about business process executions, the problem of predictive process monitoring has received substantial attention in the past years. In particular, a considerable number of methods have been put forward to address the problem of outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring, which refers to classifying each ongoing case of a process according to a given set of possible categorical outcomes\textemdash e.g., Will the customer complain or not? Will an order be delivered, canceled, or withdrawn? Unfortunately, different authors have used different datasets, experimental settings, evaluation measures, and baselines to assess their proposals, resulting in poor comparability and an unclear picture of the relative merits and applicability of different methods. To address this gap, this article presents a systematic review and taxonomy of outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring methods, and a comparative experimental evaluation of eleven representative methods using a benchmark covering 24 predictive process monitoring tasks based on nine real-life event logs.},

In this work, we initiate the development of methods to find counterfactual explanations for decision making processes in which multiple, dependent actions are taken sequentially over time. We start by formally characterizing a sequence of actions and states using finite horizon Markov decision processes and the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Building upon this characterization, we formally state the problem of finding counterfactual explanations for sequential decision making processes. In our problem formulation, the counterfactual explanation specifies an alternative sequence of actions differing in at most k actions from the observed sequence that could have led the observed process realization to a better outcome. Then, we introduce a polynomial time algorithm based on dynamic programming to build a counterfactual policy that is guaranteed to always provide the optimal counterfactual explanation on every possible realization of the counterfactual environment dynamics. We validate our algorithm using both synthetic and real data from cognitive behavioral therapy and show that the counterfactual explanations our algorithm finds can provide valuable insights to enhance sequential decision making under uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, process mining emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis of processes using event data. Classical data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, regression, association rule learning, and sequence/episode mining do not focus on business process models and are often only used to analyze a specific step in the overall process. Process mining focuses on end-to-end processes and is possible because of the growing availability of event data and new process discovery and conformance checking techniques. Process models are used for analysis (e.g., simulation and verification) and enactment by BPM/WFM systems. Previously, process models were typically made by hand without using event data. However, activities executed by people, machines, and software leave trails in so-called event logs. Process mining techniques use such logs to discover, analyze, and improve business processes. Recently, the Task Force on Process Mining released the Process Mining Manifesto. This manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. The active involvement of end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrates the growing significance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The practical relevance of process mining and the interesting scientific challenges make process mining one of the ``hot'' topics in Business Process Management (BPM). This article introduces process mining as a new research field and summarizes the guiding principles and challenges described in the manifesto.},

The events found in these domains typically refer to activities executed by resources at particular times and for particular cases. Process mining provides the means to discover the real processes, to detect deviations from normative processes, and to analyze bottlenecks and waste from such events. However, process mining tends to be backward-looking. Fortunately, simulation can be used to explore different design alternatives and to anticipate future performance problems. This keynote paper discusses the link between both types of analysis and elaborates on the challenges process discovery techniques are facing. Quality notions such as recall, precision, and generalization are discussed. Rather than introducing a specific process discovery or conformance checking algorithm, the paper provides a comprehensive set of conformance propositions. These conformance propositions serve two purposes: (1) introducing the essence of process mining by discussing the relation between event logs and process models, and (2) discussing possible requirements for the quantification of quality notions related to recall, precision, and generalization.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

  abstract = {Recent developments in causal machine learning open perspectives for new approaches that support decision-making in healthcare processes using causal models. In particular, Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) inference enables the estimation of causal treatment effects for individual cases, offering great potential in a process mining context. At the same time, HTE literature typically focuses on clinical outcome measures, disregarding process efficiency. This paper shows the potential of jointly considering the clinical and operational effects of treatments in the context of healthcare processes. Moreover, we present a simple pipeline that makes existing HTE machine learning techniques directly applicable to event logs. Besides these conceptual contributions, a proofof-concept application starting from the publicly available sepsis event log is outlined, forming the basis for a critical reflection regarding HTE estimation in a process mining context.},

  abstract = {Machine learning plays a role in many deployed decision systems, often in ways that are difficult or impossible to understand by human stakeholders. Explaining, in a human-understandable way, the relationship between the input and output of machine learning models is essential to the development of trustworthy machine-learning-based systems. A burgeoning body of research seeks to define the goals and methods of explainability in machine learning. In this paper, we seek to review and categorize research on counterfactual explanations, a specific class of explanation that provides a link between what could have happened had input to a model been changed in a particular way. Modern approaches to counterfactual explainability in machine learning draw connections to the established legal doctrine in many countries, making them appealing to fielded systems in high-impact areas such as finance and healthcare. Thus, we design a rubric with desirable properties of counterfactual explanation algorithms and comprehensively evaluate all currently-proposed algorithms against that rubric. Our rubric provides easy comparison and comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and serves as an introduction to major research themes in this field. We also identify gaps and discuss promising research directions in the space of counterfactual explainability.},

There has been much discussion of the right to explanation in the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and its existence, merits, and disadvantages. Implementing a right to explanation that opens the black box of algorithmic decision-making faces major legal and technical barriers. Explaining the functionality of complex algorithmic decision-making systems and their rationale in specific cases is a technically challenging problem. Some explanations may offer little meaningful information to data subjects, raising questions around their value. Explanations of automated decisions need not hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function. Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box. Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support. From the perspective of individuals affected by automated decision-making, we propose three aims for explanations: (1) to inform and help the individual understand why a particular decision was reached, (2) to provide grounds to contest the decision if the outcome is undesired, and (3) to understand what would need to change in order to receive a desired result in the future, based on the current decision-making model. We assess how each of these goals finds support in the GDPR. We suggest data controllers should offer a particular type of explanation, unconditional counterfactual explanations, to support these three aims. These counterfactual explanations describe the smallest change to the world that can be made to obtain a desirable outcome, or to arrive at the closest possible world, without needing to explain the internal logic of the system.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised text attribute transfer automatically transforms a text to alter a specific attribute (e.g. sentiment) without using any parallel data, while simultaneously preserving its attribute-independent content. The dominant approaches are trying to model the content-independent attribute separately, e.g., learning different attributes' representations or using multiple attribute-specific decoders. However, it may lead to inflexibility from the perspective of controlling the degree of transfer or transferring over multiple aspects at the same time. To address the above problems, we propose a more flexible unsupervised text attribute transfer framework which replaces the process of modeling attribute with minimal editing of latent representations based on an attribute classifier. Specifically, we first propose a Transformer-based autoencoder to learn an entangled latent representation for a discrete text, then we transform the attribute transfer task to an optimization problem and propose the Fast-Gradient-Iterative-Modification algorithm to edit the latent representation until conforming to the target attribute. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves very competitive performance on three public data sets. Furthermore, we also show that our model can not only control the degree of transfer freely but also allow transferring over multiple aspects at the same time.},

However, this recommendation strategy may not perform well in practice due to the sparsity of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework to mitigate the impact of the imperfect training data and empower sequential recommendation models. Our framework is composed of a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate new user behavior sequences based on the observed ones, while the anchor model is leveraged to provide the final recommendation list, which is trained based on both observed and generated sequences. We design the sampler model to answer the key counterfactual question: "what would a user like to buy if her previously purchased items had been different?". Beyond heuristic intervention methods, we leverage two learning-based methods to implement the sampler model, and thus, improve the quality of the generated sequences when training the anchor model. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory and achieve a trade-off between the information and the noise introduced by the generated sequences. Experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate our framework's effectiveness and generality.},

Though usually framed as a prediction, the spirit of recommendation is to answer an interventional question---for each user and movie, what would the rating be if we "forced" the user to watch the movie? To this end, we develop a causal approach to recommendation, one where watching a movie is a "treatment" and a user's rating is an "outcome." The problem is there may be unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which movies the users watch and how they rate them; unobserved confounders impede causal predictions with observational data. To solve this problem, we develop the deconfounded recommender, a way to use classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Following Wang \& Blei [23], the deconfounded recommender involves two probabilistic models. The first models which movies the users watch; it provides a substitute for the unobserved confounders. The second one models how each user rates each movie; it employs the substitute to help account for confounders. This two-stage approach removes bias due to confounding. It improves recommendation and enjoys stable performance against interventions on test sets.},

  abstract = {For various entering and transmission issues raised by human or system, missing events often occur in event data, which record execution logs of business processes. Without recovering these missing events, applications such as provenance analysis or complex event processing built upon event data are not reliable. Following the minimum change discipline in improving data quality, it is also rational to find a recovery that minimally differs from the original data. Existing recovery approaches fall short of efficiency owing to enumerating and searching over all the possible sequences of events. In this paper, we study the efficient techniques for recovering missing events. According to our theoretical results, the recovery problem is proved to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, we are able to concisely represent the space of event sequences in a branching framework. Advanced indexing and pruning techniques are developed to further improve the recovery efficiency. Our proposed efficient techniques make it possible to find top-k recoveries. The experimental results demonstrate that our minimum recovery approach achieves high accuracy, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique for up to 5 orders of magnitudes improvement in time performance.},

The framework of variational autoencoder (VAE) is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations. However, in real scenarios, factors with semantics are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure which renders these factors dependent. We thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes a Causal Layer to transform independent exogenous factors into causal endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We further analyze the model identifiabitily, showing that the proposed model learned from observations recovers the true one up to a certain degree. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, including synthetic and real word benchmark CelebA. Results show that the causal representations learned by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and their causal relationship as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is identified with good accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed CausalVAE model is able to generate counterfactual data through "do-operation" to the causal factors.},
